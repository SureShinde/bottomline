      <h5>It’s called “bikini medicine.”</h5>
      <p class="post-p">That’s when doctors, researchers and even the government define “women’s health” as any- thing involving the breasts and reproductive organs, the parts covered up by a bikini. And for every other disease in the book they treat us like “little men.”</p>
      <h5>It’s outrageous!</h5>
      <p class="post-p">Although we are completely different than men from head to toe, right down to the chromosome makeup behind every cell (not to mention those hormones, ladies!)...
        <br>
        <br> For decades, only the male body has been used to research treatments and drugs for heart disease, cancer, diabetes and a myriad of medical conditions. The so-called medical experts assumed they could do research on men, see what cures men, and just apply the findings to women.
        <br>
        <br> Today, a multi-billion-dollar medical industry exists around this assumption. But it turns out the assumption is wrong. Very wrong. And women like you and me are paying the price.
        <br>
        <br>In this Bottom Line Special Report, we are exposing the ugly truth about gender bias in medicine and the risks it creates for every woman. As you’re about to see, the findings are more horrifying and infuriating than any- one, including me, imagined.
        <br>
        <br>We are now finding out that millions of women are victims of bikini medicine and other misguided medical practices and myths. We are paying a steep price with our health, wellness and sometimes our lives.
        <br>
        <br>Thankfully, there are courageous researchers and physicians, both women and men, who are as fed up as I am and sounding the alarm on the unacceptable gender gap in women’s health care.
        <br>
        <br>This Bottom Line Special Report champions the doctors and medical researchers who every day confront the medical establishment in the name of women’s health.
        <br>
        <br>On every page we unmask the myths that have been leading doctors astray and resulting in misdiagnosis, over-medication and billions of dollars in unnecessary surgery on women.</p>
      <h5>And this Special Report is
just the beginning!</h5>
      <p class="post-p">There are hundreds more no-holds-barred women’s health reports in the all-new 2016 edition of The Ultimate Women’s Guide to Beating Disease and Living a Happy, Healthy Life. To further our mission of helping women live healthier, happier lives, I want to put this 372-page book into your hands for 30 days without you sending us one penny.</p>
      <h5>Keep it or return it, the
choice is yours. But whatever
you do, read it!</h5>
      <p class="post-p">In return for your time, I’ll sweeten the deal with Ageless Health, Ageless Beauty, a giant encyclopedia with over 779 breakthroughs, tips, tricks and secrets to keep you forever young and forever healthy. It’s my gift to you, free, even if you return The Ultimate Women’s Guide to Beating Disease.
        <br>
        <br>Thank you,
        <br>Sarah Edelston Hiner
        <br><em>President</em>
