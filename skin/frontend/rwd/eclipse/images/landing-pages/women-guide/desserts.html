            <h5>Coconut Delights</h5>
            <p><strong><em>Superstar nutrient:</em></strong> Coconut oil. Long con- sidered taboo due to its saturated fat, coconut oil is now gaining momentum as a health- ful food when consumed in moderation, thanks to its high levels of medium-chain triglycerides, easily digested fats that de- liver long-lasting energy and are rarely stored as fat.
              <br>
              <br><strong><em>How to prepare:</em></strong> Measure out 11⁄4 cups of shredded coconut. Place half the coconut in a food processor, and process until it reaches a chunky consistency (this may take sever- al minutes). Add in the remaining coconut shreds and 1 tablespoon of melted coconut oil. Process this until the ingredients are well mixed. Mold the mixture into the shape of golf balls, flatten and then refrigerate for an hour until firmly set. Next, mix 4 tablespoons each of melted cacao butter and cacao pow- der with 2 tablespoons of your favorite liquid sweetener such as coconut nectar or maple syrup until smooth. When the balls are firm- ly set, dip them in the cacao mixture and allow to set again in the fridge for 30 to 60 minutes. Makes six large Coconut Delights.</p>

            <h5>Jewel Fruit Tart</h5>
            <p><strong><em>Superstar nutrient:</em></strong> Almond butter. Simi- lar to peanut butter in its main health ben- efits, almond butter offers protein for muscle maintenance and is rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. But almond butter outdoes peanut butter as a source of calcium, potassium, iron and magnesium—all neces- sary for healthy bones.
              <br>
              <br><strong><em>How to prepare:</em></strong> To make the crust, pulse 2 cups of walnuts in a food processor until they become a rough flour. Add 2 cups of rai- sins, and process until a dough forms. Press the dough into a tart or pie tin, and refriger- ate for two hours. For the filling, blend 1⁄2 cup of almond butter and 1⁄4 cup each of melted coconut oil and maple syrup with 1⁄2 teaspoon of cinnamon until it’s a smooth consistency (add water if needed). Gently spread the fill- ing into the bottom of the chilled crust, and let harden in the fridge for 30 to 60 minutes.
              <br>Top off the tart with three to four cups of berries. Makes six to eight servings.</p>
