      <p class="post-p">hysterectomy can cost anywhere from $8,000 to over $100,000 depending on the type of procedure your doctor uses, your health and other factors.
        <br>
        <br> Now consider that one in three women will have an operation to remove her uterus before she turns 60. Do the math. That's a multi-billion-dollar industry!
        <br>
        <br>Dr. Daniel Morgan of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, Michigan has a big, big problem with this.&nbsp;
        <br> "Shedding a uterus should not be a rite of passage like sporting silver hair or joining AARP," he told us. To see just how bad the problem is, Dr. Morgan launched a groundbreaking study in which researchers sifted through the records of 52 Michigan hospitals to evaluate why they performed hysterectomies.
        <br>
        <br>The alarming result: Nearly one in every five women had her uterus surgically removed for no clear reason! The rate was even higher among women under 40.
        <br>
        <br> Why would any woman have a hysterectomy for seemingly no medically valid reason? One possible reason is that many women see a hysterectomy as a way to avoid uterine cancer. But that's like cutting off your foot to avoid an ingrown toenail.</p>
      <h5>There are better ways to avoid uterine cancer — One cuts risk 60%!</h5>
      <p class="post-p">For example, on page 56 you'll see how one simple lifestyle change can prevent nearly 60% of cancers in the uterus lining. We'll tell you how to reduce your risk another 7% with one daily cup of a common liquid. You must consider them before going under the knife.</p>
