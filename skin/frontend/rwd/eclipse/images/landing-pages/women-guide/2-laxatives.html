        <br>
        <br> As stunning as this finding was to all of us, it's a simple and potentially lifesaving example of how you can use the information in The Ultimate Women's Guide to make smarter, safer everyday health decisions. &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> Imagine this: You or someone you love needs a laxative and just grabs one off the drugstore shelf without giving it a lot of thought. Believe it or not, you may as well be playing Russian Roulette. Here's why:
        <br> A study published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology showed that people who choose one specific kind of laxative have a 56% lower colorectal cancer risk than people who don't use laxatives at all.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> But people who pick a second type of laxative off the shelf — including many of the most widely known brands — are clueless that they are buying a 49% higher risk of colorectal cancer!
        <br>
        <br> We name the brands and give you the details. We will not let you make the same mistake!</p>
