      <p class="post-p">We are too trusting, especially with our doctors.
        <br> When European Medical Researchers analyzed data from more than 7,400 heart attack patients they made a startling discovery:
        <br> Women are nearly twice as likely as men to die in the hospital after a heart attack!
        <br> The reason should make every woman look in the mirror and give herself a dope slap. Women waited longer than men to call for help!</p>
      <h5>Why we pause before dialing 9-1-1.</h5>
      <p class="post-p">The study concluded that one reason women delay seeking treatment is a lack of 'classic' signs (in other words, male signs) of heart attack such as intense chest pain.&nbsp;
        <br> In short, we had no idea that equally telling heart attack symptoms in women include shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or pain in the back or jaw. What's more, women's symptoms may develop slowly over hours or even days according to researchers.&nbsp;
        <br> Your doctor never told you this? If there was ever a case of "What you don't know can kill you", this is it!
        <br> Many doctors aren't aware that when it comes to heart disease symptoms, women aren't little men. They are still following the rules created by studying heart disease in men. Take heart health into your own hands with The Ultimate Women's Guide today.</p>
