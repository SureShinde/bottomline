      <p class="post-p"><strong>It beats the newfound risks of surgery.</strong>
        <br> If you're tired of hobbling around in pain from an aching hip, surgery to replace that failing joint starts sounding pretty good.
        <br> But consider two things before you climb onto the operating table:</p>
      <h5>First, your hip joint may be just fine!</h5>
      <p class="post-p">Most hip and groin pain is caused by muscle weakness or a muscle imbalance. People who correctly exercise these muscles (and we show you how) can often eliminate the pain.</p>
      <h5>Second, hip replacements fail most often in women.</h5>
      <p class="post-p">Did you know that women are 29% more likely than men to need repeat hip surgery within three years? For obvious reasons, it's not something you're likely to see hanging on the wall in your surgeon's office.
        <br>
        <br>The type of prosthetic hip you need as a woman is different than the type used in men. The femoral head is smaller and that means hip failure is more likely. It doesn't mean the surgeon messed up. It's just a fact about today's prosthetics.
        <br>
        <br>But once again women's medical needs are different and it can be costly if your doctor relies on unisex, one-size-fits all medical advice.</p>
